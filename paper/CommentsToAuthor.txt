=====================================

This is a well-written and clearly-structured paper that
presents a method for multi-view 3D object recognition and
pose estimation. It addresses important problems in the
field with a contribution towards simultaneous 3D object
recognition and 6DoF pose estimation.
However, there a number of technical issues and
inconsistencies that have been identified by the reviewers.
For instance, the authors contradict themselves regarding
the computational cost of their approach. Also, proper
comparison to other methods is lacking, as well as a more
comprehensive and up-to-date state of the art.
