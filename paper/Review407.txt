Comments to the author
======================

The paper proposed a deep learning based approach to tackle
the simultaneous recognition and pose estimation of 3D
objects. The authors suggested a deep object-agnostic
entropy estimation odel,capable of predicting the best
viewpoints of a givenobject. The obtained views of the
object are then used to predict the pose and category label
of the target object simultaneously. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness.
The proposed method is novel. The paper is well writen.

There are several issues need to deal with.
1. In the Results section,Evaluation of best-views
prediction model. Comparison between the proposed work and
other menthods such as [17] needs to be conducted.
2. The time complexity of the work is not given. It is
important for robot application.
